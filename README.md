This is an historical piece of code mine that was used to integrate the flickr api into my developed applications at the time i was working with ruby, some changes has been done in order to keep privacy safe and code history has not been keept.

This is only showing some random photos taken from my instagram to just have some data to test it.

Originally Developed in 2015.
